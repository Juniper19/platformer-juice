10 min - finding and importing assets and plugins
45 min - learning about platforming modifiers, what makes movement polished and playing around with values til I was satisfied with movement mechanics
15 min - setting up player animations for all states (running, idle, wall grab, jump, etc.)
15 min - camera2D node functionality, now lags behind player, documentation study
1.5 hours - setting up a parallax background with the parallax2D node. I get it now, but not sure how to make it scale right with pixel art without it being huge, so left this out
2 hours - mastering the hell out of tile sets and tile maps - autotiling, collision layers, terrain maps, etc. for various resolutions and z-index layers, for platforms and props
30 min - configuring double jump particles with GPUParticles2D node.. ultimate fail BUT better understanding of this node for the future
30 min - figuring out lighting for torches, experimenting with directional light node vs point light
