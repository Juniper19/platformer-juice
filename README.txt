GAMEPLAY LEVEL
2 hours - trying to set up dialogue for the signs. This is hard. Wow.
30 min - making UI elements for (failed) dialogue system in Aseprite
30 min - building flappable lever that will toggle spikes. THIS WORKS. later.. messes up :/ But spikes and lever exist.
90 min - sketching then building new level with branching options for exploration, loops back at the start, slowly introduces new movement mechanics
1 hour - lost progress due to my own lack of commits. this is where lever logic gets messed up. Attempts at restoring logic with a new, better system. Oh well. Learned a lot
30 min - friends play the level! Documentation of their feedback to improve upon in the future, but made small changes to pacing, easier jumps earlier on, addition of smiley face, etc.



ADDING JUICE - old
10 min - finding and importing assets and plugins
45 min - learning about platforming modifiers, what makes movement polished and playing around with values til I was satisfied with movement mechanics
15 min - setting up player animations for all states (running, idle, wall grab, jump, etc.)
15 min - camera2D node functionality, now lags behind player, documentation study
1.5 hours - setting up a parallax background with the parallax2D node. I get it now, but not sure how to make it scale right with pixel art without it being huge, so left this out
2 hours - mastering the hell out of tile sets and tile maps - autotiling, collision layers, terrain maps, etc. for various resolutions and z-index layers, for platforms and props
30 min - configuring double jump particles with GPUParticles2D node.. ultimate fail BUT better understanding of this node for the future
30 min - figuring out lighting for torches, experimenting with directional light node vs point light
